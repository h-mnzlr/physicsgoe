# Physicsgoe

This is my collection of - mostly python - applications I wrote to ease my workload while studying physics in Georg-August Universität Göttingen, Germany.

Applications include mostly
- simple StudIP wrapper for the web API to automatically sync files for all my courses
- snippets to automate repetitive tasks like linear regression and fitting of functions
- tool to easily read parts of excel style work books into pandas dataframes
- self implemented algebra program to calculate symbolic derivatives (yet still only useful for numerical calculations, yeah I know)
- put everything together to provide a easy interface to work with data and process it to do stuff like error propagation and similar

Future goals are the implementation of symolic integration (similar to sympy, which I really dislike) and to try to implement an autoprotocol program
that makes educated guesses to automatically process the data from an experiment and write it into a protocol template.
